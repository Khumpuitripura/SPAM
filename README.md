# SPAM
This project is a simple but effective spam email classifier built using Python and scikit-learn. It uses a labeled dataset of emails (spam and ham) and applies natural language processing techniques along with a machine learning algorithm (Multinomial Naive Bayes) to train a model that can predict whether a given email is spam or not.
